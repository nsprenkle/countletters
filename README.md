# countletters
As an RA in college, I often had to create bulletin boards that required large titles made of paper letters cut from a machine. Since this was a long, laborious process, there was a need for an easy, error-proof, way of counting the multiplicity of those letters to avoid mistakes/rework.

Thus, countletters was born.

Oiginal work by the talented [Benny Mei](https://github.com/meibenny); forked with permission and stylistically tweaked/enhanced for a better user experience.

Code is free to use, modify, profit, etc.
